GrowBit: Agent-Powered Goal Achievement System
Welcome to GrowBit, a groundbreaking application built for the ETHSF hackathon that redefines personal growth through autonomous onchain intelligence. Using AgentKit by Coinbase, GrowBit empowers users to set personal growth goals in natural language, while an AI agent autonomously generates customized task sequences, verifies completion, distributes crypto micro-rewards, and adapts the plan based on user performance—all seamlessly integrated with blockchain technology. This project showcases the potential of AgentKit to abstract crypto complexities, facilitate agentic commerce, and push the limits of what autonomous agents can achieve.

Project Vision

GrowBit is more than just a goal-tracking tool—it’s an experiment in autonomous motivation. By combining advanced AI with AgentKit’s blockchain capabilities, we’ve created an agent that acts as a personal coach, financial incentivizer, and adaptive strategist. Whether you’re learning a new skill, improving your health, or tackling a passion project, GrowBit makes the journey engaging, rewarding, and effortless, with crypto micro-rewards delivered directly to your wallet.

Features

Natural Language Goal Setting: Describe your personal growth goals in your own words—no rigid forms required.

Autonomous Task Generation: An AI agent crafts a tailored sequence of tasks to guide you toward your goal.

Task Verification: Submit evidence of completion, and the agent verifies it using AI-driven analysis.

Crypto Micro-Rewards: Earn small crypto rewards for every verified task, powered by AgentKit’s seamless blockchain integration.

Adaptive Intelligence: The agent learns from your performance, adjusting tasks to keep you challenged yet motivated.

Why This is Innovative
GrowBit leverages AgentKit in a way that pushes the boundaries of autonomous agents and aligns with ETHSF’s prize criteria:
Agentic Commerce Revolution: The agent autonomously manages crypto reward distribution, creating a frictionless payment rail that motivates users without requiring them to understand blockchain mechanics.

Best Crypto UX: AgentKit abstracts all crypto complexities behind a natural language interface, making rewards feel intuitive and accessible to anyone, regardless of crypto expertise.

Crazy Experiment: An autonomous agent that acts as a personal growth coach, verifies real-world task completion, and self-funds rewards via blockchain rails demonstrates a bold new paradigm for AI-driven motivation.

This isn’t just useful—it’s a wild, creative leap into what agents can do when given financial autonomy and a mission to inspire human growth.
