## Smart Wallet Features

GrowBit leverages Base Sepolia's integration with Coinbase Wallet to provide smart wallet capabilities:

- **Gas-Free Reward Claims**: When using Coinbase Wallet, reward claims are gas-free through paymaster sponsorship.
- **Enhanced Security**: Better security through account abstraction.
- **Simple UX**: No approvals needed for common operations.

These features are automatically available when connecting with Coinbase Wallet, but the application remains fully compatible with standard EOA wallets like MetaMask and Rabby Wallet.
